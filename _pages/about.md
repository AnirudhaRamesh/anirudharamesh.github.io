I'm a Research Engineer at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com), where I work on applying and creating new AI capabilities across domains including Deep Reinforcement Learning ([DeepPCB](https://deeppcb.ai)), LLM Post-training, Genomics and Drug Discovery, Agentic Research Assistants, and financial modeling.

Previously, I pursued my Masters in Robotics at the [Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), advised by [Jeff Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/) and [Christoph Mertz](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/christoph-mertz/), focusing on computer vision in rare domains using multispectral inputs.

I spent 6 months interning at Adobe MDSR, India, working with [Mayur Hemani](https://in.linkedin.com/in/mayur-hemani) and [Balaji Krishnamurthy](https://in.linkedin.com/in/balaji-krishnamurthy) on Few-Shot Learning research.

I studied Computer Science Engineering at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I worked with [Professor Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) on vision systems for autonomous driving.
