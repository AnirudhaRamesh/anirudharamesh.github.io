I'm a graduate student at Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Jeff Schneider and Christoph Mertz. Our efforts are mainly directed towards computer vision in rare domains using multispectral inputs. 

Prior to this, I spent 6 months interning at Adobe MDSR, India, working with Mayur Hemani, and Balaji Krishnamurthy where we worked on Few Shot Learning.

I studied Computer Science Engineering at IIIT Hyderabad, and primarily worked with Professor Madhava Krishna on vision in relation to autonomous driving.
