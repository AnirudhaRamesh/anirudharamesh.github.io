I'm Research Engineer at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com), where I work on applying and creating new AI capabilities in a variety of domains ranging from Genomics and Drug Discovery, to Agentic Research Assistants, DeepRL for real-world problems, financial modeling and optimization, and more. 

Previously, I was pursing my Masters in Robotics at the [Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), advised by [Jeff Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/) and [Christoph Mertz](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/christoph-mertz/). Our efforts are mainly directed towards computer vision in rare domains using multispectral inputs. 

Prior to this, I spent 6 months interning at Adobe MDSR, India, working with [Mayur Hemani](https://in.linkedin.com/in/mayur-hemani), and [Balaji Krishnamurthy](https://in.linkedin.com/in/balaji-krishnamurthy) where we worked on Few Shot Learning.

I studied Computer Science Engineering at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), and primarily worked with [Professor Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) on vision in relation to autonomous driving.
