I'm a Research Engineer at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com), working on LLM post-training, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and AI for Science. I'm building [DeepPCB](https://deeppcb.ai), the leading PCB routing and placement product, and contributed to [Laila](https://www.instadeep.com/2024/11/07/introducing-laila/), the world's first AI Lab Assistant (covered in [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/0f0e3c8a-8b1a-4c3a-9c3a-3e3c0f0e3c8a), [Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/), and more). I also mentored research pushing the frontier in long-range genomics, enabling inference of ultra-long sequences >1Mbp on a single GPU with zero-shot generalization to sequences 100× longer than seen during training ([Website](https://instadeepai.github.io/nucleotide-transformer-v2-inference-v2/), [ICLR 2025 papers](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2025/Conference)). 

I'm currently also working on improving compute-aware inference strategies in LLMs (post-training) and advancing AI safety via weak-to-strong generalization with a focus on effective oversight as models get stronger.

## Background

I completed my Masters in Robotics at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), advised by [Jeff Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/) and [Christoph Mertz](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/christoph-mertz/). I designed and deployed a perception system for 24/7 off-road autonomy using multi-spectral inputs, and introduced a domain adaptation framework that outperformed existing methods by +40% mIoU ([Thesis](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publications/learning-to-see-in-the-dark-and-beyond/)).

Previously, I interned at Adobe's Media and Data Science Research Lab, where I discovered and solved biases in Few-Shot Segmentation datasets and methods, improving performance by ~5% mIoU ([NeurIPS 2021](https://papers.nips.cc/)).

I studied Computer Science at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) (CGPA: 9.32/10.0, Dean's Research Award), working with [Professor Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) on monocular multibody SLAM for autonomous driving, achieving 3× smaller tracking error than previous state-of-the-art ([IEEE IV 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/), [IV 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/), [VISAPP 2021](https://www.scitepress.org/)).
