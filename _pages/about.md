I'm a Research Engineer at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com), where I work on applying and creating new AI capabilities in a variety of domains ranging from **Genomics and Drug Discovery**, to **Agentic Research Assistants**, **Deep Reinforcement Learning** for real-world problems, financial modeling and optimization, and more.

## Background

Previously, I pursued my **Masters in Robotics** at the [Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), advised by [Jeff Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/) and [Christoph Mertz](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/christoph-mertz/). Our research focused on **computer vision in rare domains** using multispectral inputs.

Prior to CMU, I spent 6 months interning at **Adobe MDSR, India**, working with [Mayur Hemani](https://in.linkedin.com/in/mayur-hemani) and [Balaji Krishnamurthy](https://in.linkedin.com/in/balaji-krishnamurthy) on **Few-Shot Learning** research.

I studied **Computer Science Engineering** at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I worked with [Professor Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) on vision systems for **autonomous driving**.

## Research Interests

My research spans multiple areas of AI and robotics:
- **Machine Learning for Genomics** and drug discovery
- **Autonomous systems** and computer vision
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning** applications
- **Few-shot learning** and transfer learning
- **Agentic AI** systems
