I'm a Research Engineer at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com), working on LLM post-training, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and AI for Science. I'm building [DeepPCB](https://deeppcb.ai), the leading PCB routing and placement product, and contributed to [Laila](https://www.instadeep.com/2024/10/ai-day-2024-instadeep-showcases-innovations-in-biology-and-ai-as-part-of-the-biontech-innovation-series/), the world's first AI Lab Assistant (covered in [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/64b1bb33-095e-4cc5-a911-50df76fa3d1d), [Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/24/10/41139262/google-deepmind-biontech-unveil-ai-lab-assistants-to-revolutionize-scientific-research), and [more](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/biontech-instadeep-bet-genai-models-advance-rd-drug-discovery-cancer-treatment)). I also mentored research pushing the frontier in long-range genomics, enabling inference of ultra-long sequences >1Mbp on a single GPU with zero-shot generalization to sequences 100× longer than seen during training (ICLR 2025 LMRL [Website](http://anirudharamesh.github.io/iclr-long-range-genomics/) & [Spotlight Talk](https://youtu.be/1jHulfClXms)). 

I'm currently also working on improving compute-aware inference strategies and advancing AI safety via weak-to-strong generalization with a focus on effective oversight as models get stronger.

## Background

I completed my Masters in Robotics at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), advised by [Jeff Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/) and [Christoph Mertz](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/christoph-mertz/). I designed and deployed a perception system for 24/7 off-road autonomy using multi-spectral inputs, and introduced a domain adaptation framework that outperformed existing methods by +40% mIoU ([Thesis Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkUtPgfxGhk), [Paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=_xTXoTQAAAAJ&authuser=1&citation_for_view=_xTXoTQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC)).

Previously, I interned at Adobe's Media and Data Science Research Lab, where I discovered and solved biases in Few-Shot Segmentation datasets and methods, improving performance by ~5% mIoU ([NeurIPS 2021](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BlcUQYxknbX)).

I studied Computer Science at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) (CGPA: 9.32/10.0, Dean's Research Award), working with [Professor Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) on monocular multibody SLAM for autonomous driving, achieving 3× smaller tracking error than previous state-of-the-art ([IEEE IV 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03528), [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cchPIaKSSvM), [IV 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9575767), [VISAPP 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07613)).
